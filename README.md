# World Engine

A C# library that generates tile-based fictional worlds. 

## What's this for?

The purpose of this project is to provide developers with a practical tool to procedurally generate interesting worlds which can also be extended and customized. Its primarily meant to be used in games and world-building tools but it can be changed to fit other needs.

## Examples

> **Please note that the examples shown are generated by a debug function meant to quickly visualize a map. Every implementation will have different ways of visualizing maps.**
